      "This cheat sheet will walk you through the process of installing Python and some associated libraries on your local machine (laptop or desktop). You can do this one of two ways, both described in detail below. The first way is to use the <a href=\"https://www.enthought.com/\">Enthought</a> bundled distribution. It is free for users with an academic (.edu) email address and is strongly recommended for Mac users, due to Mac's pre-exisiting Python installation which can conflict with extra libraries. The Enthought Windows distribution works very well also. The other way to install Python is by grabbing the files directly from the Python websites and installing manually. This procededure has only been tested for Windows machines. \n",
