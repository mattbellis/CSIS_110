However, to solely credit Nirvana for being the driving force behind grunge would be a mistake and would undersell the importance of Pearl Jam, The Smashing Pumpkins, and even lesser-known acts like Mudhoney and Screaming Trees. \n",

They gasp in awe as the cetacean rises from the depths and flings itself into a different world...*our world* as effortlessly as you and I taking a breath. But as we marvel at this creature, we cannot help but think about what else lies beneath the depths. If this whale can exist and thrive, how diverse, how amazing must the full ecosystem be? Are there even greater beasts down there?\n",

      "In October of 1991, Soundgarden relased the album \"Badmotorfinger\". While many would credit their follow-up album ``Superunknown\" and its hit single ``Black Hole Sun\" as being their breakthrough project, they would be wrong. \"Badmotorfinger\" was representative of Soundgarden fully in control of their powers. A devestating album that laid waste to so much that came before and still continues to echo and resonate in our collective music consciousness, whether we know it or not. Soundgarden was mighty and they had gifted us with this masterpiece. If Nirvana is the whale that awes us as we gaze upon it, Soundgarden was the deeper power that we know exists, but can scarcely fathom (see what I did there?). Soundgarden was Leviathan. Soundgarden was the Midgard Serpent. Soundgarden was mighty Cthulhu slumbering beneath the waves, delivering a beautiful madness on all those who listened to their non-Euclidean tonalities. \n",
